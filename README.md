# AR Radiation Visualization

## Overview
The **AR Radiation Visualization** is an augmented reality (AR) application developed in Unity, designed to visualize radiation zones and help users understand radiation behavior, shielding, and safety measures. The app serves as an educational tool for both students and professionals, providing an immersive experience to simulate real-world radiation scenarios.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to create an interactive platform for learning about radiation, including how radiation spreads, how it interacts with shielding materials, and how distance impacts radiation exposure. The app allows users to visualize radiation zones in real-world environments using AR technology, providing a unique, hands-on learning experience.

## Key Features
- **Basic Radiation Simulation**: Visualize the spread and intensity of different types of radiation in real-time.
- **Shielding Interaction**: Simulate the effects of various shielding materials (e.g., lead, concrete, water) on radiation intensity.
- **AR Integration**: Utilize Unity’s AR Foundation to place radiation zones on real-world surfaces using augmented reality.
- **Interactive Learning**: Allow users to modify radiation source intensity, observe shielding effectiveness, and understand key safety protocols.
- **Mobile Support**: Compatible with ARCore and ARKit-enabled mobile devices.

## Future Features
- **Improvements to Radiation Simulation**: Refine radiation simulation models with expert input to improve the accuracy of particle behavior and physics.
- **Realistic Particle Interactions**: Enhance the simulation by incorporating air particle collisions and more advanced shielding interactions.
- **Advanced AR Toolkit**: Upgrade AR plane detection by integrating more specialized toolkits (e.g., Niantic’s Lightship) for improved accuracy and performance.
- **Interactive Training Modules**: Implement guided tutorials to teach users about radiation safety, shielding, and handling hazardous materials.
- **Multi-Device Support**: Expand the application to support a wider range of mobile and AR devices.

## Research Background
Research has shown that augmented reality (AR) significantly enhances learning and comprehension in complex scientific fields. Studies such as Radu (2014) and Dunleavy & Dede (2014) have demonstrated that AR enables students to visualize and interact with abstract concepts, leading to improved spatial reasoning and deeper understanding.
